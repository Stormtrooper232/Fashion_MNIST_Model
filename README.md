# Fashion_MNIST_Model
A very basic fashion_mnist model. 
It analyses 68x68 grayscale images of clothing and determins what type of clothing they are. 
It uses 10 epochs and a 128 unit hidden layer to achieve 88% accuracy, with a loss of 0.337. 
Each epoch takes 3 seconds, for a total of 30 seconds of training time.

Feel free to copy it, use it, or whatever.
it can be ran directly with python.

It also includes some nice little matplot info things.
